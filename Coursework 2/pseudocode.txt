Pseudocode

1. Initialize the first layer and second layer
2. Initialize the boundary conditions and initial conditions for the first layer

for loop depends on time
    3. Initialize the boundary conditions for second layer since it depends on time
    4. Instantiate the matrix for A and B for second layer
    5. Get the b matrix from the first layer
    6. Update the B matrix to include the b matrix from the 2nd layer
    7. Solve for AT = B where T is temperature (variable)
    8. Unpack solution into second layer
    9. Second layer is now updated to first layer
    10. Reset second layer
